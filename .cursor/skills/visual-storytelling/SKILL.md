# Visual storytelling (Orbit)

Turn a page into a **scroll story**: numbered chapters, oversized type, one idea per beat. Keep the cyber/space brand. Do not rebuild a Webflow theatre.

## When this applies

- Hub, About, Portfolio, live desks (`/portfolio/live/*`)
- User asks for visual storytelling, cinematic layout, or narrative dashboards
- Adding a new public section that would otherwise become a 3-up `GlassCard` grid

Interior tools stay tools: Studio, week log, `/card`, `/qr-code`.

## Named verify

Primary: Hub `/` renders chapter ids `story-open`, `story-gravity`, `story-craft`, `selected-work`, `story-live`, `story-signals`, `story-close`; `npm run build` exits 0.

Then a browser walk (desktop + a ~390px viewport):

1. Scroll Hub end to end; the top line fills; Gravity rings turn; craft rows spotlight. There is no fixed chapter bar.
2. Competency rows are plain `<a href>` to field cards (not `next/link`)
3. Proof reel: scrolling down advances the cards to the right; Case study and architecture still work. Reduced motion: swipe the rail.
4. Live peek reel: sneak-peek image + `desk.question` as the headline; scrolling down advances cards; the card opens `/portfolio/live/{slug}`. Reduced motion: swipe the rail.
5. About experience reads as a timeline, not stacked glass cards
6. `/portfolio` is the shared headline, then workshop reel → live peek reel → Power BI reel → GitHub list. No copied Home close. `/portfolio/live` uses the same reel. Home uses the same `max-w-5xl` column as Blog.
7. `prefers-reduced-motion`: story still readable; no required animation

## Minimum evidence (open before editing)

1. This skill + `reference.md`
2. Brand tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (`.orbit-accent`, `.text-story`, reduced-motion block)
3. Existing copy in `src/content/profile.ts` / `src/content/live-desks.ts` — re-hierarchy, do not invent slogan copy
4. `docs/essay-voice.md` stranger test for any new sentence a visitor will read

## Scene grammar

A page is a sequence of **chapters**, not a stack of sections.

| Beat | Job | Orbit example |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Open | One thesis in huge type; identity is supporting | Hub: “Prove what works.” + name as kicker |
| Metaphor | Make the brand visible | Gravity field: center + satellites |
| Craft | Numbered process (how the work actually happens) | Delivery → Data → AI with `hudVerbs` |
| Proof | Horizontal reel of evidence | Showcase writes |
| Live | Peek reel of questions | sneak peek + `desk.question` → `/portfolio/live/{slug}` |
| Signals | Horizontal reel of essays | Category · title · date |
| Close | Landing, not another grid | About + contact |

Rules:

- **One idea per chapter.** If you need a card grid to “fit three things,” you do not have a scene yet.
- **Type is the primary image.** Photography/video is optional; Orbit’s image is Syne at `.text-story` / `.text-display` plus the orbit ring.
- **Numbers are characters.** Cadence, zone count, €/m² — `StoryStat` / `.orbit-accent` display figures, not a muted mono row.
- **No scroll-jacking.** Do not hijack vertical scroll (no `preventDefault` on wheel, no vertical snap, no pin-jack libraries). Scroll-linked motion is allowed: progress line, ring rotate, in-view spotlight, count-up, `StoryReveal`, and sticky **reels** (`ScrollRail`) whose `translateX` is driven by native vertical scroll. The track moves on the first scroll once the reel reaches the top of the viewport. Every reel uses `ScrollRailCard` with no viewport-width override. Craft, GitHub, and the About timeline stay vertical. Signals is a reel. No fixed chapter bar. Copy must remain readable without the motion.
- **Reduced motion always works.** `motion-safe:` only. Reels fall back to a swipe rail. Copy must not depend on animation.
- **Field cards** live as static HTML in `public/`. Home competency links stay plain `<a>`.

## Component map

| Primitive | Path | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| `StoryScene` | `src/components/story/StoryScene.tsx` | Chapter inside the shared `max-w-5xl` column |
| `ChapterMark` | `src/components/story/ChapterMark.tsx` | `01 / Craft` + title + lede |
| `StoryHeadline` | `src/components/story/StoryHeadline.tsx` | Shared two-line title on public pages |
| `GravityField` | `src/components/story/GravityField.tsx` | Brand diagram |
| `StoryStat` | `src/components/story/StoryStat.tsx` | Oversized KPI |
| `DeskStoryHeader` | `src/components/story/DeskStoryHeader.tsx` | Live desk opening: cadence → question |
| `DeskCast` | `src/components/story/DeskCast.tsx` | 3–5 `StoryStat` figures before the map |
| `DeskPicture` | `src/components/story/DeskPicture.tsx` | Primary visual (map / tape / mix / board) |
| `DeskClose` | `src/components/story/DeskClose.tsx` | Source, lag, what this is not |
| `DeskMissing` | `src/components/story/DeskMissing.tsx` | Snapshot missing; `question` as `h1` |
| `ScrollLine` | `src/components/story/ScrollLine.tsx` | Top read bar; Hub / Portfolio / About / live (via AppChrome) |
| `ScrollSpot` | `src/components/story/ScrollSpot.tsx` | Brightens the row in the viewport midline |
| `StoryReveal` | `src/components/story/StoryReveal.tsx` | Scale/rise when a beat enters view |
| `ScrollRail` | `src/components/story/ScrollRail.tsx` | Reels (Hub Proof, live, Signals, Portfolio workshop, Power BI): vertical scroll moves cards immediately; swipe if reduced motion |
| `LiveDeskReel` | `src/components/live/LiveDeskReel.tsx` | Hub / Portfolio / live index: peek + question on a `ScrollRail` |
| `LiveDeskTile` | `src/components/live/LiveDeskTile.tsx` | One desk card: sneak peek + `desk.question` as headline |

AppChrome: public pages share `max-w-5xl`. A single live desk (`/portfolio/live/[slug]`) may use `max-w-6xl` for the picture. Do not full-bleed Home. Do not silently widen Studio.

## Live dashboards (next applications)

A desk is already a story if it keeps **one question**. Visual storytelling means the **reading order**, not a new chart library.

1. **Open** — `DeskStoryHeader` (cadence kicker + question as `h1`). Never title the desk with the dataset name first.
2. **Cast** — 3–5 `StoryStat` figures that answer the question before interaction (latest €/m², FI price, HICP). Do not bury them under the map.
3. **Picture** — the map, tape, or mix is the scene. Full width of the live column. Do not wrap the primary visual in `GlassCard` unless it is a peek/tile.
4. **Move** — hover/press changes the same scene (zone desk, spotlight country). Do not open a second page for the default drill.
5. **Close** — source, lag, and what this is not (“delayed quotes; not a trading terminal”). Missing snapshots use `DeskMissing` with the desk `question`, not the dataset name.

When adding a new desk:

- Put `question` on `LiveDesk` in `src/content/live-desks.ts` first
- Surface it on Hub / Portfolio / `/portfolio/live` via `LiveQuestions` / `LiveDeskReel` (sneak peek + question as the card headline)
- Build the desk as Open → Cast → Picture → Move → Close
- Verify the live reel still shows the peek and the question

Do not: iframe a Power BI report as the story; duplicate Hub glass cards onto the desk; add a marketing hero above the question.

## Quality gates (reject / rewrite if any fail)

| Gate | Fail if |
|------|---------|
| Card relapse | New Hub/About block is a 3-up `GlassCard` grid with eyebrow + title + description |
| Scroll theatre | Vertical scroll-snap, pin-jacking, parallax that hides copy, or motion required to read |
| Slogan drift | New headlines that a stranger cannot map to `profile.ts` / desk `question` |
| SEO identity | Hub `h1` omits the person’s name (name may be the kicker inside `h1`, thesis the display span) |
| Field-card SPA | Competency uses `next/link` to `/field-card/` (soft-nav 404) |
| Orbit paint | Animated OKLCH channels or `color: var(--orbit-accent)` for text (see ARCHITECTURE brand notes) |
| Interior leak | Studio / week log / card HUD restyled as cinematic chapters |
| Desk rename | Live desk `h1` is the dataset name instead of the question |
