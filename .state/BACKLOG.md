- [ ] **Orbit 2.0 Evidence Layer** — (1) ~~audit~~ draft in `docs/product/EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md` (owner review), (2) ~~name flagship~~ owner selected **Interactive Decision Storytelling**, (3) ~~publish flagship on Orbit~~ local port + Portfolio teaser (2026-09-24; uncommitted), (4) case study Write + deeper evidence chain, repeat. Decision Intelligence Lab is not the selected flagship.

- [x] **Visual storytelling Portfolio** — `/portfolio` Open → workshop reel → live peek reel → Power BI picture → GitHub list → Close. No 3-up GlassCard grid.
- [x] **Home column + shared title** — same `max-w-5xl` column as Blog; story headline on public pages; human-judgment message; fix scroll rails so card 1 stays in frame and every rail shares one card width; drop the chapter bar and the Portfolio close that copies Home; plain desk questions. Verified on localhost 2026-09-22. Not committed.
- [ ] **Rail punctuality desk** — `/portfolio/live/rail`. Digitraffic / Fintraffic CC BY 4.0; corridor delay %, not a GPS map.
- [x] **Finland Power Pulse folded into EU Spot** — not a separate live tile; `/portfolio/live/power` redirects to `/eu-spot`. Press a zone for the Pulse-style desk + mix nowcast.
- [x] **Helsinki Housing Pulse** — `/portfolio/live/housing`. Stat.fi `ashi`, monthly, ~1 month lag, CC BY 4.0. No empty page.

- [x] **Live desk snapshot clock** — GHA `Refresh live desks` daily 13:00 UTC (mix, housing, economy, EU Spot + pulse). Pushed `07220d6`. `ENTSOE_SECURITY_TOKEN` set as a repo secret. Nordic Equity stays on heatmap-web.
- [x] Hub SDLC + Credit Risk field cards (Orbit-hosted HTML, HUD lanes, sitemap)
- [x] SDLC opening in plain steps (plan, specify, design, build, test) — localhost 2026-09-22
- [x] **Story field card** — `/story-field-card/`. Hub competency Story. Spine dwell → claim → sketch → lead → open (rewritten 2026-09-24 after the checklist version was rejected). Orbit-hosted. Not in FIELD_CARDS.
- [ ] **SDLC / Credit Risk source repos** — create `sdlc-field-card` and `credit-risk-field-card`, copy discovery + Apply review from analytics/delivery on a **monthly** cadence (1st 17:00 discover / 18:00 review).

- [x] **EU Spot Desk (localhost)** — `/portfolio/live/eu-spot` map + history. Energy-Charts until ENTSO-E token. Do not deploy while `localhostOnly`.
- [x] **EU Spot → ENTSO-E A44** — token in `.env.local`; `live:fetch-eu` prefers A44; `localhostOnly: false`. Consider public deploy after owner review.
- [x] **EU Spot multi-domain pulse** — Market/Load/Gen/Transmission/Outages/Balancing/Operation/OMI; map hover + zone desk. Refresh: `npm run live:fetch-eu-pulse`.

- [x] Owner: evaluate identity HUD on localhost `/card` and `/qr-code`
- [ ] **fitness-coach: emit Arc `stats.spd` + Codex `max_speed_kmh`** — rolling best max speed from stride/sprint efforts, GPS outliers dropped; include in the unweighted gate mean only when a sample exists; write the same km/h onto weekly Codex points so Studio history can draw. Orbit HUD and Codex pane already render.
- [x] Fitness Status: remaining HP bar + ▲▼− trends (STR blank until lift-log sample)
- [x] Arc HUD sixth stat SPD (display + essay demo; live number waits on fitness-coach `stats.spd`)
