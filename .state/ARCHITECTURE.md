# Architecture (working log)

> Tracked in git. Living decisions for this repo — not a substitute for `docs/architecture/`.

## Overview

Orbit is a Next.js personal HQ: Blog (MDX Writes), Portfolio (workshop + GitHub + Power BI screenshots + live desks at `/portfolio/live`), Related articles RSS cache, Studio (profile + week log + roadmap), architecture sync, weekly digest (Resend auto-send; test-to-self until go-live). Public discovery via `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` / blog `feed.xml`, plus Vercel Analytics.

**Product truth (2026-09-23):** Root `PRODUCT.md` + `docs/product/*` are authoritative for identity layers (HUd WHO / Hub WHAT / Studio WHERE / timeline HOW). Agents must Scope-check via `docs/product/AGENT_RULES.md`. Wired from `.cursor/rules/product-kit.mdc`.

**Doc currency (2026-10-02):** One owner per topic in `docs/ops/doc-registry.json`. Retired prose moves to `docs/archive/` and the old path stays as a short `Superseded by` pointer when links still need it. `npm run docs:check` (inside `ship:check`) fails if a pointer grows, a primacy phrase shows up outside the owner, README cites a missing path, or a diagram file is missing from `docs/architecture/README.md`. Pull requests also fail when `.cursor/automations/` changes without `.state/AUTOMATION_CONTRACT.md`. Rule: `.cursor/rules/docs-currency.mdc`.

## Data shapes

| Name | Shape / location | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| FeedSource | `src/lib/news/sources.ts` | `name`, `url`, `category`, optional `maxItems` |
| NewsCache | `data/news-cache.json` | Fetched via `npm run news:fetch` |
| Live EU Spot | `data/live/eu-spot.json` | `npm run live:fetch-eu` (A44) + `npm run live:fetch-eu-pulse`. Price refresh keeps existing `pulses` until the pulse step rewrites them. Map category layers + per-zone desk (Finland-style pulse + mix nowcast for every zone). Power Pulse is not a separate Portfolio desk — `/portfolio/live/power` redirects here. |
| Live Helsinki Housing | `data/live/housing.json` | `npm run live:fetch-housing`. Stat.fi `ashi` monthly 15iq + quarterly 13mv (Helsinki history + HKI 1–4). CC BY 4.0. Capital-region choropleth (`HousingMap`) paints ~150 postal codes from yearly ashi 13mu €/m² (sales-weighted flats + terraced) via `housing-postal-paths.ts` (Paavo pno, CC BY 4.0) — Asuntomaatti-style grain. |
| Live Europe Power Mix | `data/live/power-mix.json` | `npm run live:fetch-mix`. Energy-Charts `public_power` last 24h → country 100% stacked shares (fossil/nuclear/wind/hydro/solar/biomass/other), sorted clean→fossil. |
| Live Europe Economy Pulse | `data/live/economy.json` | `npm run live:fetch-economy`. Eurostat HICP (`prc_hicp_manr` history merged with early `teicp000`) / unemployment / consumer confidence / GDP + ECB deposit facility + ECB press/statistics RSS (EA21) + Google News economy wires per spotlight country/EU (incl. DK, NO). Desk defaults to euro area (EA21); spotlight selector filters KPIs and headlines. |
| Published workshop projects | `data/published-projects.json` (+ `.seed.json`) | `liveUrl` = demo; `caseStudyUrl` = `/writes/...` |
| Writes | `src/content/writes/*.mdx` | `showcase: true` → Home Selected work |
| Essay feedback | `data/essay-feedback.json` | Keyed by essay slug → `{ title, entries[] }` with `rating`, optional `note`, and ISO `at` |
| Studio roadmap | `data/studio-roadmap.json` (+ `.seed.json`) | `focusNow` (public on `/card` only) + private milestones (`planned`/`active`/`evidence`/`proven`). Persist via `persistDataJson` same as profile. Store: `src/lib/studio-roadmap.ts`. |
| Directive archive | `data/directive-archive.json` | Read-only snapshot of `AlexTouvras/AlexTouvras` `governance/`. Private `/studio/directives`. Not a second editor. Do not add this file to `RUNTIME_DATA_FILES` — the page reads the deployment copy, not GitHub at request time. |
| Newsletter digest draft | `data/newsletter-draft.json` | Titles/links only. Gitignored locally; persist send status via GitHub |
| Newsletter subscribers | Resend Audience, or `RESEND_NEWSLETTER_TEST_TO` | Emails never in git. Test-to skips the audience entirely |
| Ravens findings | GitHub Contents on `AlexTouvras/ravens` | Weekly highlights: one item per domain that moved (inbox first). `RAVENS_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Week log | `/studio/week` (+ `/2026-W36/fitness` etc. for other ISO weeks; legacy `?week=` redirects) via `src/lib/week-log/` | ISO week hub. Fitness lane renders `ArcStatusCard` from plan `narrative` + `daily_quest` (fitness-coach repo). Codex opens with `GateBell`: the normal curve, letter bands, and this week's gate plus stat marks. Stats order: STR, AGI, SPD, END, VIT, PER. SPD is peak velocity (max speed); omitted until the plan JSON includes `stats.spd`. `narrative.health`: max = 100 + VIT, fill = Body Battery share. Heimdall embeds inline (Technique on lifts, Watch on Ravens parenting). Auth: GitHub allowlist + 90d sliding session; password fallback; `STUDIO_DEV_OPEN` locally |
| Fleet registry | `docs/ops/fleet.yaml` | Daily unattended-job checks for `#ops-channel`; cloud evidence is GitHub + Slack only |

## Design patterns

- Hub is a **chaptered scroll story inside the same `max-w-5xl` column as Blog**. Open → Gravity → Craft → Proof reel → Live peek reel → Signals reel → Close (Home only). Shared primitives live in `src/components/story/` (`StoryHeadline`, `StoryScene`, `ChapterMark`, `GravityField`, `DeskStoryHeader`, `DeskCast`, `DeskPicture`, `DeskClose`, `DeskMissing`, `StoryStat`, `ScrollLine`, `ScrollSpot`, `StoryReveal`, `ScrollRail`). Public pages share `max-w-5xl`; only `/portfolio/live/[slug]` is `max-w-6xl`. `StoryHeadline` (mono kicker + two display lines) is the title on Home, Blog, Portfolio, About, Contact, Related, Newsletter, and the live index — each page has its own line. No fixed chapter bar. Scroll-linked motion is native: a top `ScrollLine`, Gravity rings/satellites that turn with the chapter’s scroll (sticky diagram on `lg+`), `ScrollSpot` on lists, `StoryReveal` scale-in, `StoryStat` count-up, and `ScrollRail` on **reels** (Hub Proof, live desks, Portfolio workshop, Power BI). Every reel card is `w-[min(40rem,86cqw)]` against the column. Vertical scroll translates the track as soon as the reel reaches the top of the viewport. After the first measure, a scroll event refreshes progress so the opening card does not jump to the end. Lists stay vertical. No wheel capture / vertical snap. AppChrome paints `ScrollLine` on `/`, `/about`, `/portfolio`, `/writes`, `/contact`, `/radar`, `/newsletter`, and `/portfolio/live`. `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps reels as swipe rails.
- `/portfolio` uses the same column and title: Open (“What survived / the cut.”) → **flagship teaser** (`FlagshipTeaser` → `/stories`) → workshop `ScrollRail` → live peek reel (`LiveDeskReel`) → Power BI `ScrollRail` of report pictures (pages stay on the card; enlarge lightbox) → GitHub as an editorial list. No copied Home close. Not a wrapping `GlassCard` grid. Portfolio `#live` and `/portfolio/live` share the same peek reel. Desk questions are plain (“Where is electricity expensive today?”). Workshop and Power BI pass `fit` on `ScrollRail`: the sticky frame is `100dvh - 7.5rem` and cannot grow past the phone. The card body (project blurb, report preview) shrinks before the links and page controls. Other reels keep the growing frame.
- **Interactive Decision Storytelling (flagship)** is authored in `AlexTouvras/storytelling` and mirrored into this repo by `npm run stories:sync` (`scripts/sync-storytelling.mjs`). A push to storytelling `main` dispatches `storytelling-sync`; the Orbit workflow copies the engine, builds, and pushes so Vercel redeploys `/stories`. Routes: `/stories` (landing), `/stories/[slug]`, `/stories/[slug]/method`, `/stories/<slug>/film`, `/stories/lab/*`. Engine under whatever `src/components/<folder>` storytelling has (storytelling, film, director, reader, onepager, and the next one) + `src/illustrations/` (`.riv` binaries) + `src/stories/` + `src/lib/loadStory.ts` / `sim/` / `director/` / `reader/` / `rive/` + `data/figures/`. Component folders, lib subfolders, and loose lib files are discovered from the storytelling checkout (`cn.ts` and `prefers-reduced-motion.ts` stay skipped; their imports are rewritten). The workflow stages those parent trees, so a new engine folder ships without a second allowlist edit. A new npm dependency still has to be added to Orbit `package.json`, or the pre-publish build fails and nothing ships (2026-09-28: `how-much-fast-reserve` needed reader, director, illustrations, and Rive; 2026-09-29: share cards needed `src/components/onepager`). Sync rewrites `@/lib/cn` → `@/lib/utils`, `prefers-reduced-motion` → `use-prefers-reduced-motion`, and storytelling home links to `/stories`. StoryHero keeps the tighter top padding because `/stories` has no absolute header. `src/app/stories/page.tsx` stays Orbit-owned except `LISTED_SLUGS`. Depends on `zod` + `react-scrollama` + `@rive-app/canvas` / `@rive-app/react-canvas` (pinned to storytelling's versions). AppChrome gives `/stories*` full-bleed with no site header. Canonical positioning remains in the sibling repo’s `docs/FLAGSHIP.md`.
- Live desk tiles (`LiveDeskTile` inside `LiveDeskReel`) carry a sneak peek + the desk **question** as the headline: EU Spot paints the live baseload SVG; Nordic Equity paints a treemap from `heatmap-web` `board.json` (not an iframe of the board page); Helsinki Housing paints a monthly €/m² sparkline; Europe Power Mix paints mini 100% stacked country bars; Europe Economy Pulse paints euro-area HICP. Hub `/`, `/portfolio` `#live`, and `/portfolio/live` all use this reel (`ScrollRail`; vertical scroll drives the track). Each live desk page is Open → Cast → Picture → Move → Close: `DeskStoryHeader` (question as `h1`), 3–5 `StoryStat` figures before any click, full-column map/tape/mix, interaction on the same scene, then source/lag/what-it-is-not. Missing snapshots use `DeskMissing` with the desk `question`, not the dataset name. Nordic Equity Cast is computed server-side from `fetchHeatmapBoard()` (up/down/leader).
- SEO: App Router `sitemap.ts` / `robots.ts`; site URL from `getSiteUrl()` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`); JSON-LD Person/WebSite/Blog in layout + BlogPosting/BreadcrumbList on Writes; per-Write OG via `writes/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` (shared `src/lib/seo/og-card.tsx`); optional Write frontmatter `updated` for freshness; blog RSS at `/feed.xml`; `public/llms.txt`; app `icon.tsx`. New MDX Writes inherit SEO automatically from frontmatter — no per-post meta authoring.
- Field-card static HTML in `public/*-field-card/` should keep `canonical` + `og:url` + `og:image` (points at site `/opengraph-image`). Source field-card repos own the HTML and may overwrite on sync — preserve those meta tags when refreshing cards.
- Homepage field cards mount one storytelling robot (`public/field-card-robot.mjs`). The script reads that commit's six bubble lines, section lines, and accent from storytelling `field-cards.ts` (`ai`, `delivery`, `analytics`, `sdlc`, `credit`, `story`). SDLC uses Delivery violet; Story uses AI cyan. On the sheet, scroll writes the section at 38% of the viewport into all six bubble runs; a fine pointer writes the section under the cursor. A heading that is not in `sections` keeps the six static lines. It stays off when the sheet is iframed by `/stories/<card>`, and it hides in print. The Agentic AI sheet inlines the same follow behavior in `public/field-card/index.html` (storytelling `host/ai-field-card-robot.mjs`). Storytelling sync does not copy `host/` or `public/`, so these two files are copied by hand. Approve re-inserts the tag on Analytics and Delivery via `ensureFieldCardRobot` so a source-repo sync does not drop it. Bayes is a method card and does not get the robot.
- **Story field card** (`public/story-field-card/`) uses the shared field-card sheet grammar (hero + layer stack, problem→use→example, tri, kill list, foundation). Message is the OS spine: Question → Evidence → Tension → Narrative → Experience → Decision; craft five-words as the always-on strip. No scroll-graph instrument.
- Portfolio cards: Case study link from `caseStudyUrl`, or from `liveUrl` when it is already a `/writes/` path
- Showcase essays for featured workshop projects (Ledger, Power BI, Orbit, Heatmap)
- Personal-ops projects (mealplan, fitness coach) stay non-featured; Write + `/architecture/` case study, not Home Selected work
- Essay footer feedback is anonymous, rate-limited, persisted to JSON, and still uses `localStorage` only as a one-browser re-submit gate.
- Essay pages read their own feedback entries server-side and render a newest-first note list below the feedback CTA.
- Essay feedback Slack notifications prefer `SLACK_ORBIT_WEBHOOK_URL` (for `#orbit`) and fall back to `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- Weekly Write Slack draft / publish / skip notifications prefer `SLACK_ORBIT_WEBHOOK_URL` (`#orbit`) and fall back to `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- Weekly digest: **GitHub Actions Tuesday 07:15 UTC is primary** (Vercel Hobby cron went silent after 2026-08-18). Vercel `/api/cron/newsletter` Tue 08:00 UTC is backup; `already_sent_this_week` via `data/newsletter-draft.json` on GitHub prevents doubles. `RESEND_NEWSLETTER_TEST_TO` mails only that inbox; unset it to broadcast. **No Slack** for digest content — email only. Public subscribe stays closed while test-to is set. Ravens section is **one highlight per domain that moved this week**, not a vault dump.
- Daily ops check is a separate Cursor Automation on `Orbit`/`main` at 08:00 GMT+3 posting only exceptions to `#ops-channel`. It is propose-only and must not infer local state from `~/.cursor`; registry and playbook must exist on GitHub `main`.
- Studio week log is owner-only (`STUDIO_PASSWORD` emergency + GitHub OAuth allowlist + `noindex`). Token chain: `OPS_GITHUB_TOKEN` → `RAVENS_GITHUB_TOKEN` → `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Do not put the week log in public nav. Heimdall embeds inline with `youtube-nocookie` (Technique on fitness lifts; parenting Watch on Ravens); falls back to the watch URL.
- Fitness course strip on `/studio/week/fitness` writes sibling `fitness-coach` via `coach-course` locally. On Vercel, Apply dispatches `studio-apply-course` on fitness-coach (GitHub Action regenerates the week and commits). Needs `OPS_GITHUB_TOKEN` Contents: Read and write on fitness-coach. Skin (Arc) is not a weekly slicer. Past race dates expire out of taper.
- Brand accent orbit: hex keyframes on unlayered `.orbit-accent` (direct `color` animation) + `@property --orbit-accent` `<color>` for bg/border/mix. Tailwind `neon-cyan` is a **fixed** rest-state cyan (`--accent-cyan`); body links (Case study, Read, nav CTAs) do not ride the loop. Section eyebrows and hero totals do, via `.orbit-accent`. `--orbit-fg-delay` is applied after hydrate (`OrbitSync` layout effect, not a `Date.now()` SSR script) so new mounts join mid-cycle without a hydration mismatch. Avoid `oklch()` in animated tokens (LightningCSS → lab/@supports; Chromium can blank `color: var(...)`). Never animate OKLCH channels via `@property <number>`. Topic AI uses fixed `--accent-ai` / `neon-ai`. Violet/blue stay fixed.
- Studio profile save: local always writes `data/profile.json`; Vercel requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and commits for redeploy. UI must show the real server message (not a blanket "Live site updated").
- Vercel `ignoreCommand` (`scripts/vercel-ignore.mjs`) skips rebuilds when a commit only touches runtime-read GitHub JSON (news cache, essay feedback, newsletter/weekly-write drafts). Profile, published projects, Writes, field cards, and Power BI screenshots still build. Fail-open: if git cannot list files, Vercel builds.
- ProjectBrain showcase (2026-09-02): essay `when-the-portfolio-needs-a-memory.mdx` (`featured` + `showcase`); portfolio card + `/architecture/projectbrain` synced from `Memory/docs/architecture/`.
- Public Writes are stranger-first (`docs/essay-voice.md`): gloss workshop nicknames; category follows the decision rule (rotate Delivery/Learning/Career/general data; do not default Power BI). Active clone for Writes is this `website/` repo; `Documents/Orbit` can lag.

- **About (2026-10-03):** `/about` opens with the same two-line headline as the other public pages: “Complex problems” / “into decisions.” One sentence under it. Stats are years, languages, and degrees. Experience and education titles show the institution’s mark and open its site in one press. Download CV closes the page.

## Key decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-10-03 | Employer and school titles open the official site | Owner: the letter tiles were not logos, and the place note was an extra click. `PlaceMark` is the institution’s symbol. `PlaceLink` is a direct link. `/about/[slug]` is gone. |
| 2026-10-03 | Story & record is the credit-and-risk path, then one question | Owner copy: started in credit and risk, then data, machine learning, and technology delivery. The question is set in display type: how do you build intelligent systems that survive contact with the real world? `cv.summary` stays off the page. |
| 2026-10-03 | About headline stays the two-line public shape | Owner: the three sentences were the right idea and too long for the hero. Line is “Complex problems”, accent is “into decisions.”, and one sentence covers data, AI, delivery, and a system a team can use. |
| 2026-10-03 | About headline, languages, and CV close | Owner: the “still my name on the check” line did not read, and the employer count mixed a conscript term with the banks. Bullets stay the CV record. CV download closes the page. Place notes from this same day were removed; titles open the institution site. |
| 2026-10-02 | Doc currency is a registry plus `docs:check`, not a periodic rewrite | Two files both said "read this first" (`docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` from July, `docs/automation-contract.md` beside `.state/AUTOMATION_CONTRACT.md`). Secrets and the ship checklist moved into the `.state/` contract. The old files are pointers. Archives keep the prose. README no longer tells people to add `src/content/projects/*.mdx`. |
| 2026-09-30 | Private `/studio/directives` reads the governance snapshot | `AlexTouvras/AlexTouvras` `governance/orbit-studio/` is the published view of the directive archive. Studio home links it. Login, `noindex`, and `robots` disallow `/studio`. The public site does not list it. Edits stay in that archive; refresh by copying a new `data/directive-archive.json`. |
| 2026-10-01 | Field-card robot speech follows the section on screen | Storytelling PR 30. `public/field-card-robot.mjs` is `host/field-card-robot.mjs`. The AI sheet inlines `host/ai-field-card-robot.mjs`. Sync does not copy either file. |
| 2026-09-30 | One storytelling robot on every homepage field card | Storytelling PR 25 binds six lines and an accent. Orbit sheets load that character from `main` (`public/field-card-robot.mjs`). Agentic AI keeps its own script. Approve re-inserts the tag on Analytics and Delivery. Bayes stays without it. |
| 2026-09-30 | Public title under the name is `profile.role` (`AI & Data Systems Lead`); the portrait opens `/card?face=arc` | Owner: website title is the role, and pressing the avatar opens the Arc HUD. Hub and About kickers use the role (sentence case). Pillars stay on the Home ticker. `IdentityCardFlip` starts on the Arc face when `face=arc` and `/api/card/arc` returns a gate; strangers still get the identity card. The portrait on the identity face flips the same way. |
| 2026-10-01 | Arc Mode line under the name is Warrior | Owner: that line still said AI & Data Systems Lead and should say Warrior. Name stays the title. Gate stays the status line. The public site title stays the role. |
| 2026-09-30 | Arc Mode title is the name, then the role | The portrait caption was the hardcoded class “Warrior”. Under the Arc Mode kicker the title is `profile.name`, then `profile.role`. Gate rank stays the status line. No class label. |
| 2026-09-30 | Agentic field-card discovery should also search practice writing | GitHub framework search never surfaced essays. Discover should read Anthropic Engineering, Ars Contextus, and filtered Simon Willison entries, plus four web queries. Hits can earn a job row, not a picker row. Seen URLs live in that repo's `data/practice-seen.json`. Patch: `docs/ops/agentic-field-card-practice-search.patch` (this agent cannot push `agentic-ai-field-card`). |
| 2026-09-29 | Storytelling sync discovers engine folders | A handwritten mirror list plus a second `git add` list dropped every new folder (`onepager` share cards, earlier reader/director/Rive). The pre-publish build then failed and the push never landed. Discovery plus staging the parent trees stops that. New npm dependencies still need `package.json`. |
| 2026-09-21 | Hub is a chaptered visual story; live desks keep question-as-h1 | Owner asked to leave the traditional card-grid HQ for storytelling (inspiration: AI Takes Over, Light Factory, Amanda Lee Peers, OSOS, Haus of Words) without Webflow theatre. Skill: `.cursor/skills/visual-storytelling`. |
| 2026-09-21 | Hub scroll story: things happen as you scroll, without jacking | Owner: inspiration sites move as you read down; Orbit was still a static chapter stack. Allowed: progress line, gravity rotate/orbit, sticky kicker, in-view spotlight, count-up, `StoryReveal`. Forbidden: pin-jack / vertical snap. |
| 2026-09-21 | Reels (Proof, workshop, Power BI, live desks) track vertical scroll | Owner: should Systems I've built — and PBI — move right as you scroll down. Live desks later needed sneak peeks + the question on the same rail. Lists stay vertical. `ScrollRail` is the primitive. |
| 2026-09-21 | Live desks follow Open → Cast → Picture → Move → Close | Owner: apply the Hub recipe on `/portfolio/live/*`. Cast answers the question before a click; missing states keep the question as `h1`. |
| 2026-09-21 | `/portfolio` follows Hub grammar without full-bleed | Owner: apply storytelling to the remaining public card-grid HQ. Workshop is a reel; GitHub is a list; live desks are a peek reel; Power BI is a report picture reel. |
| 2026-08-29 | Newsletter is email-only — no Slack digest FYI | Owner: do not post newsletter contents to Slack |
| 2026-08-29 | Newsletter primary = GHA Tue 07:15 UTC; Vercel cron Tue 08:00 backup | Vercel-only path produced zero Resend sends after 2026-08-18; GHA catch-up worked |
| 2026-08-31 | Fleet ops field-card check: skip open `chore/weekly-refresh-*` when same repo already merged that ISO week | Delivery W35 had PR #3 live + orphaned discovery PR #4; daily check kept paging #ops-channel |
| 2026-08-29 | Weekly Write Approve: hard-gate Slack notify until draft verified on GitHub default branch + NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL set; link origin never defaults to localhost | Preview/Approve opened dead hosts or "Draft not found" — gitignored draft is not on Vercel FS; Slack links signed as localhost when notify ran locally |
| 2026-08-17 | Digest Ravens = one highlight per domain this week | Test email was a vault dump; owner asked for weekly highlights only |
| 2026-09-22 | Ravens frontmatter with an unquoted colon is quoted and retried; one bad note cannot zero the section | `fi-first-latch` title (`latch: let`) threw js-yaml and `fetchRavensForDigest` returned `[]`, so Tue 22 Sep mail had no beats |
| 2026-08-17 | Private week log at `/studio/week` behind Studio session, not a secret URL | Reuse existing password + noindex; lanes read git artifacts including CareerOps daily-digest / weekly-scan |
| 2026-08-17 | Digest auto-sends; `RESEND_NEWSLETTER_TEST_TO` for solo validation | Owner will judge the email in-inbox, not via Slack Approve |
| 2026-08-11 | Fitness coach systems Write + non-featured portfolio card | Ops loop (git/Slack/Automations/Intervals), not training diary; same personal-ops lane as mealplan |
| 2026-08-11 | Data Analytics Field Card + shared Orbit field-card registry | Same weekly discovery → Cursor judgment → #orbit Approve process as AI card; stack is ASK/GRAIN/TRUTH/USE (not a Fabric brochure) |
| 2026-08-13 | Technology Delivery Field Card + Hub competency href | Same weekly discovery → Cursor judgment → #orbit Approve as AI/analytics; stack is INTENT/WINDOW/PROOF/CUTOVER (not a Scrum/SAFe brochure) |
| 2026-08-13 | Field cards: verb lede + Always-on strip; AI gets LLM floor | Family pattern from poster comparison; MCP stays tool reach, not orchestration |
| 2026-08-03 | Weekly Write Slack posts full essay in-channel (chunked sections); `githubSynced` required for preview/Approve | Teaser + browser preview 404'd when Cloud Automation left the pending draft on a feature branch only |
| 2026-07-26 | Orbit `caseStudyUrl` → `/writes/building-orbit` | Essay existed; card lacked Case study link |
| 2026-07-26 | Heatmap case study Write + `caseStudyUrl` | Featured live board had no write-up |
| 2026-07-26 | Dropped ProjectHelm Write; JARVIS `/architecture/jarvis` remains historical-only backlink | Essay was present-tense under a retired banner; Hub voice pass preferred removing it over rewriting |
| 2026-07-26 | Vercel Analytics over Plausible/GA; link-out Garmin skipped | Hosted on Vercel; zero-config traffic; no hobby surface this phase |
| 2026-07-27 | Essay feedback persists to `data/essay-feedback.json` by slug, with Slack ping on submit | Keeps feedback close to the essay corpus and easy to surface later in Studio without adding a DB |
| 2026-07-27 | Weekly Write Slack target → `#orbit` via `SLACK_ORBIT_WEBHOOK_URL` | Keep essay drafts with Orbit feedback in one channel instead of `#career-ops` |
| 2026-07-24 | Optional `thesisUrl` / `thesisTitle` on `CvEducation`; About education cards link out when set (ProjectCard-style) | Surface theses without Portfolio clutter; Bachelor stays static |
| 2026-07-24 | Trim AI to OpenAI + Simon `entries` (max 8 each); drop InfoQ DevOps + TDS + Personal Kanban; add Databricks/DuckDB/MotherDuck/Dagster + RADACAD/Data Mozart + Scrum.org | Chronological feed and weekly essays read as AI-only despite balanced cache counts |
| 2026-07-30 | Agentic field card hosted as static `public/field-card/`; home AI competency links there | Keep standalone HTML (print/LinkedIn) outside Orbit chrome; competency is the discovery path |
| 2026-08-03 | Slack Approve syncs field-card `index.html` → Orbit `public/field-card/` | Pages updated on merge; site copy was stale until this lockstep commit + Vercel redeploy |
| 2026-08-10 | Vercel `WEEKLY_WRITE_SECRET` must match Cloud Automation / local signing secret (preferred over bare `CRON_SECRET`) | Preview/Approve tokens failed with `invalid signature` when Vercel `CRON_SECRET` drifted from the automation signer; draft must also live on GitHub default branch |
| 2026-08-11 | Field-card pipeline fail-closed: discovery Slack ping + Sat/Mon judgment watchdog + Approve notify requires `## Summary` | W32 stalled silently when Friday Cursor Automation missed; silence meant “nothing happened” |
| 2026-09-05 | Field-card judgment watchdog: drop Saturday cron; keep Friday pass + Monday escalate | Saturday after Friday is redundant; owner asked to keep Friday only |
| 2026-09-05 | Field-card week always ships (stamp-only counts); discovery CI moves to Thursday and skips if the week already merged | Late Friday GHA opened duplicate PRs after review; agentic/analytics never published W36 |
| 2026-08-11 | Field-card pipeline fail-closed: discovery Slack ping + Sat/Mon judgment watchdog + Approve notify requires `## Summary` | W32 stalled silently when Friday Cursor Automation missed; silence meant “nothing happened” |
| 2026-08-11 | Field-card repo must carry the same `WEEKLY_WRITE_SECRET` as Orbit/Vercel (not only stale `CRON_SECRET`) | Preview/Approve tokens signed in field-card CI failed with `invalid signature` on production |
| 2026-08-12 | Public "Why Orbit" brand copy on Hub, About, and `building-orbit.mdx` | Name/metaphor was internal-only; visitors need the center-of-gravity story without reading maintainer docs |
| 2026-08-12 | Canonical local clone is `website/` only | Removed stale `Orbit/` duplicate and Cursor shadow folders pointing at the same repo |
| 2026-08-12 | Pixel avatar beside name on Hub + About (`profile.avatarUrl`, `PixelAvatar`) | Stylized identity mark without weakening typography-first heroes; JSON-LD Person `image` when set |
| 2026-08-13 | Brand foreground accents: unlayered `.orbit-accent` + hex `color` keyframes; `--orbit-accent` `<color>` (hex) for bg/border only | Channel `@property` + `oklch(var(--orbit-l)…)` and even `color: var(--orbit-accent)` went white on prod Chromium after LightningCSS; owner confirmed hex fg animation |
| 2026-08-13 | Hub accent targets = “Why the name”, header hexagon, cyan OrbitSignature, MissionHero stats, **all** `SectionHeading` eyebrows | Owner: labels like Core competencies should orbit together, not only one |
| 2026-08-13 | About CV role titles use `.orbit-accent` | Same cyan→purple loop as section eyebrows; were static `text-neon-cyan` |
| 2026-08-13 | Home About is a plain section (no GlassCard); About page Background / Why Orbit prose unboxed too | Boxed blurb sat next to unboxed section headings |
| 2026-08-13 | `neon-cyan` is static; only `.orbit-accent` / `--orbit-accent` bg-border utilities orbit | Home Case study / Read: inherited animated `text-neon-cyan` painted on one sibling only; all-or-none → none |
| 2026-08-13 | `SLACK_ORBIT_WEBHOOK_URL` on Vercel + GH Actions (Orbit + field-card repos); weekly CI prefers `#orbit` | P1-02; legacy `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` remains fallback only |
| 2026-09-05 | Fitness course strip on Studio week fitness: event date + stance + lift intent/density as Sunday input | Owner evaluates on localhost; past race dates must not stick in taper |
| 2026-09-05 | Cursor `canvases/` stay local (gitignore + tsconfig exclude) | First committed `.canvas.tsx` failed ship-check: Next cannot resolve `cursor/canvas` |
| 2026-09-05 | Studio Apply on Vercel = `repository_dispatch` → fitness-coach GHA | Vercel has no fitness `.venv`; `OPS_GITHUB_TOKEN` must be Contents write on fitness-coach |
| 2026-09-09 | Arc remaining HP: max = 100 + VIT, fill = Body Battery share | VIT formula unchanged; bar not in the gate letter |
| 2026-09-22 | SDLC opening is the life cycle in plain steps: plan, specify, design, build, test | “Gate chain / layers / lanes” did not read. Cutover still sits on the Delivery card. |
| 2026-10-02 | SDLC pillars are plan & design, build & verify, release & deploy, maintain & improve | The sheet was still a pre-release handoff to Delivery. H1 is “Build software that stays in use.” Calendars, proof, and cutover stay on Delivery. The hosted sheet robot speaks the SDLC lines in `public/field-card-robot.mjs` so a storytelling sync cannot put the Delivery sentence back on `/sdlc-field-card/`. |
| 2026-10-02 | SDLC verify includes the security checks | Threats are named in design. The checks that fail the build sit in verify, with the tests. |
| 2026-10-02 | SDLC improve is continuous improvement from use | Maintain stays the defect and the patch. Improve is the next change from what you learn while it is in use, through the same four pillars. Not a SAFe loop. |
| 2026-09-30 | SDLC hosted pass reads `public/sdlc-field-card/PLAYBOOK.md` | The playbook holds the three lines that must stay: a one-page plan, a spec is not shared understanding, a person drops tests that do not fail for the right reason. Not an AI-native brochure. |
| 2026-09-30 | Hosted SDLC month starts with research, then update or no-change | The 17:00 pass was re-judging rows already on the card. `PLAYBOOK.md` “Monthly research” requires opened sources in the PR Summary. Credit, Story, and Bayes stay picker/jobs judgment. Fleet `bad_output` if the hosted PR has no SDLC research note. |
| 2026-09-24 | Data & visual storytelling field card on Hub/HUD (`/story-field-card/`). Spine DWELL → CLAIM → SKETCH → LEAD → OPEN. Orbit-hosted. Not in FIELD_CARDS. | Owner rejected the first card as a checklist. Rewritten from Lupi, Cairo, and Segel & Heer as an art: a life, a sentence, a mark, a path, a visible doubt. |
| 2026-09-24 | `/card` flips to the fitness Arc HUD only for a Studio session (`/api/card/arc`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`). Public HTML stays the identity card. | Owner asked to join the two cards. Visitors do not get a progress dashboard. |
| 2026-09-21 | SDLC + Credit Risk field cards on Hub/HUD as Orbit-hosted HTML | Distinct spines from Delivery (cutover) and Analytics (grain). Weekly source repos later — do not register phantom GitHub repos in FIELD_CARDS |
| 2026-09-21 | Public field-card review is monthly | Footers say Next: month, not week of. SDLC/Credit stamped on Orbit (`hosted-field-card-monthly-review.json`). |
| 2026-09-21 | Field-card discovery is monthly too | All five Hub cards: 1st 17:00 discover + 1st 18:00 source-repo review. Fleet `monthly_after` on the 2nd. Local IDE renamed the four live automations to Monthly (GetAutomation). Hosted SDLC/Credit UUID not listed from Cloud Agent. |
| 2026-09-09 | Public identity HUD at `/card`; on-screen QR at `/qr-code`; About avatar opens the HUD | Calling card for IRL scans. No extra About hero button. QR encodes current origin so localhost/LAN works. `/qr-code` is noindex. |
| 2026-09-09 | HUD lane hints use field-card thesis (`hudTitle` / `hudVerbs` / `hudDescription`); Home keeps skill blurbs | Phone scan should show stack-not-dashboard / sequence-not-ticket, not the Hub competency paragraph |
| 2026-09-30 | HUD tap lines and the Delivery / Credit field-card heroes share one summary | Owner still saw the old headlines on the sheets. Delivery hero is “Match the calendars, then cut over.” Credit hero is “Credit risk is for a lifetime. Act early.” Hub pillars say Storytelling. Delivery’s source repo can overwrite `public/delivery-field-card/` on the next monthly publish. |
| 2026-09-11 | EU Spot map uses real bidding-zone polygons (entsoe-py GeoJSON → SVG), not country choropleth | Owner asked for actual map; MIT-licensed zone shapes |
| 2026-09-22 | Visual storytelling stays on live desks | Owner: the Anthropic-style reading order (question, cast of figures, picture, a comparison you can move) is for `/portfolio/live/*`, not weekly Writes. Essays stay MDX prose. |
| 2026-09-23 | Orbit 2.0 Foundation: `PRODUCT.md` + `docs/product/*`; HUd WHO / Hub WHAT / Studio WHERE; HUD NOW = `focusNow` only; Foundation = infrastructure not career achievements | Owner-locked identity (AI & Data Systems Lead); agents Scope-check via AGENT_RULES; branch `orbit-2-foundation` |
| 2026-09-23 | After Foundation ship: next phase = Evidence Layer (audit → gap → one flagship). Lab is candidate only. `/card` shows STATEMENT only (no NOW box). Foundation website milestones = EVIDENCE; archetype not PROVEN. | Owner direction 2026-09-23 |
| 2026-09-22 | Native live desks refresh on GHA `Refresh live desks` (13:00 UTC); commit triggers a Vercel rebuild | Nordic Equity fetches heatmap-web at request time. EU Spot, Housing, Power Mix, and Economy are JSON in the deployment bundle. Do not `[skip vercel]`. EU Spot scripts use `tsx --conditions=react-server` because `entsoe-xml` / `eu-categories` import `server-only` (plain `tsx` throws). EU Spot runs only when `ENTSOE_SECURITY_TOKEN` is a repo secret. |
| 2026-09-11 | EU Spot prices from ENTSO-E A44 when `ENTSOE_SECURITY_TOKEN` set; Energy-Charts fallback | Owner generated API token; clears localhost-only license gate |
| 2026-09-11 | Finland Power Pulse folded into EU Spot; mix nowcast on every zone | Owner: remove Pulse from Portfolio; press-a-zone desk is the same reading order for FI as for every other bidding zone. Nowcast is hourly OLS on ENTSO-E mix, not Energy-Charts 15-min FI. |
| 2026-09-11 | EU Spot mix peek: dock under the map on small screens; float inset-clamped on `md+` | Phone tap clipped the overlay (`overflow-hidden` + `w-72` at the finger). In-flow card shows the full window. |
| 2026-09-11 | Write SEO is frontmatter-driven and automatic | Per-slug OG + BlogPosting/Breadcrumbs + sitemap freshness from `date`/`updated`; authors never hand-write meta for new posts |
| 2026-09-11 | Helsinki Housing Pulse live desk from Stat.fi `ashi` (monthly 15iq + quarterly 13mv) | Next queued desk after EU Spot; CC BY 4.0; refuse empty snapshot; flats-only grain matches liquid Helsinki market |
| 2026-09-25 | Storytelling `main` pushes sync into Orbit and redeploy `/stories` | Owner: updates should show without a manual port. Private read is a deploy key; storytelling dispatches `storytelling-sync`. |
